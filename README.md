# Fioria

Check out docs in [docs](docs). This will have the information that you will need to get involved in the project and a lot more information about what the project is.

## Summary

We are trying to build an MMO from Elixir, Phoenix and PhaserJS. Each player will be able to create a family. Each family will continue to have a new member added upon the previous one dying. You will inherit some of the previous family members items. This game will have general crafting, fighting and exploring. We would like to make this into a Roguelite where each character dies permanently. You must craft, kill monsters and earn money to bring glory to your family. 

## How To Play
